Due to limited space in the transportation, the main luggage can be stored while guest just take along a day-bag with content for 2 days.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Road conditions</strong> in Indonesia are not always very good and this can cause slow driving times.

Overland travel is not advised during the two weeks from 16<sup>th</sup> to 31<sup>st </sup>May 2020. Especially the ferry crossing between Java and Bali may be blocked.

Since we are not able to advice on any matters regarding vaccinations or other precautionary medical measures, we recommend the consultation of a travel- or tropical-medicine doctor.</li></ul><ul><li>Prices are <strong>valid 30 days from date of offer</strong>. Past this date price and conditions may be readjusted. We reserve the right to adjust prices for exceptional circumstances which are not under our control with a notice period of 30 day prior to travel. Services which are already paid are exempt from this.</li></ul><ul><li>Our prices are in United States Dollars (USD). Several of the services that we quote, are being paid in local currency – the Indonesian Rupiah (IDR). In case of any significant change oft the official exchange rate of more than 5% to our disadvantage, we reserve the right to adjust prices. This would be done with a minimum notice period of 30 days.</li></ul><ul><li>Our prices are based on a petrol price of 7.400 Indonesian Rupiah (IDR) / liter. Should the petrol price increase more than 10%, we reserve the right to adjust our prices with a minimum notice period of 30 days.</li></ul><ul><li>Reservations during <strong>peak seasons</strong> (Christmas, New Year, High Season, and National Holidays) may be subject to supplementary charges, obligatory meals or minimum-stays. In certain cases, these may be announced late by supplier and hotels and may only be communicated upon the receipt of your confirmation of a booking.</li></ul><ul><li>Please note that all the above services &amp; tours have <strong>yet to be booked</strong>, they are proposed for your information only and we will not make any reservations before we receive your confirmation to do so. Availability is always subject to change until booking confirmation form our side.</li></ul><ul><li>If any proposed service(s) is/are <strong>not available at the moment of booking</strong>, we will try to find other possibilities/options or other similar service(s) in order to avoid changes to the program.</li></ul><ul><li>Note that <strong>certain experiences</strong>, such as blessings by a priest, the visit of an astrologer, etc. are linked with cultural and social obligations on the side of the providers that may change with very short notice, and thus are always subject to change. Cancellations from the supplier-side with short notice have occurred, and in such cases we would always try to re-schedule the activity or experience.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Room/Bedding-Configuration</strong>: Prices per person based on twin sharing relate either to accommodation in a Twin-, a Double- or a so called “Hollywood”-Double Bed configuration. The third bed for accommodation requested in Triple-rooms is often not a full-size single bed, but an extra-bed / roll-away bed / sofa-bed that can vary in size and standard from the regular bedding in the room.</li></ul><ul><li>Rooms at hotels are available only from <strong>check-in time</strong> at 14:00 pm on arrival day till <strong>check-out time</strong> at 12:00 o’clock noon on departure date. A supplement may need to be added if early check-in or late check-out is desired.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Accommodation and service standards</strong> in remoter islands in Indonesia, and also in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Flores, Sumba and other islands can be very basic and cannot be compared to those in Java or Bali. In some areas also the transportation means are of more basic standard.</li></ul><ul><li>The <strong>cost of air tickets</strong> is subject to change without prior notice by the airlines. Flight tickets are issues as soon as we receive a booking confirmation. In case of any cancellation of a booking prior the period within which advised cancellation charges apply, we reserve the right to charge cancellation charges for flight tickets according to the airline cancellation policy.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Train tickets</strong> are issued as soon as we receive a booking and passport details of the passengers, and the ticketing is opened on the side of the railway company (usually 3 months prior to travel). For any change in travel dates or any cancellation of the tour – also prior to the period within which advised – cancellation charges do apply. We reserve the right to charge for the cancellation of the train tickets according to the railway company cancellation policy. Usually this is for any change of date and for any cancellation the full train ticket price.</li></ul><ul><li>Bringing an additional day-bag: For guests <strong>travelling by train</strong> it is strongly advised to bring a day-bag. Luggage is usually not transported on the train and needs to be collected on the evening prior to departure and arrives late after arrival of the guests. The same applies for <strong>all travelers to Tangkahan and groups (GIT) Samosir in Sumatra</strong>. Due to limited space in the transportation, the main luggage can be stored while guest just take along a day-bag with content for 2 days.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Road conditions</strong> in Indonesia are not always very good and this can cause slow driving times. As a general rule we calculate 30 km = 1 hour driving. This can be even less when traveling in very remote areas and jungles with 4WD jeeps. Also some islands are very populated which during public holidays and long weekends can cause traffic problems that can influence your journey time considerably.</li></ul><ul><li>Note that <strong>visits to volcanoes</strong> are always subject to change and may be cancelled due to weather conditions or volcanic activity during time of travel; volcano trekking is not possible during rainy months from November to March, except for Bromo, Ijen and Batur volcanoes, where clearance only depends on the daily weather situation.</li></ul><ul><li>We do not encourage activities that do actively involve <strong>wildlife,</strong> such as dolphin tours, etc. For activities where guests come in touch with wildlife, very high standards apply and are carefully monitored in our side. Note that upon wildlife observations, including bird watching, and also Orang Utan trekking trips in North Sumatra or Kalimantan there is never a guarantee to see certain bird or primates. In the months between July and September the probability to see Orang Utans in the wild or at feeding stations, may be slightly lower than during other months of the year.</li></ul><ul><li>During the rainy season, especially during January and February <strong>boat transfers</strong> between Bali and Lombok or Gili Islands may be delayed or cancelled due to wave conditions in the Lombok Strait. We do strongly recommend using flights during that time! Occasionally cancellations also occur during the dry season. At any time it is strongly recommended to add one interim-night between a speedboat transfer and onward travel. Any flights should not be scheduled on the same day after a speedboat transfer.</li></ul><ul><li>Due to visibility, currents, higher waves and fast changing weather conditions, we refrain from booking <strong>dive excursions</strong> in Bali during the rainy season months from December to mid-March. All dive excursions take place at own risk and we reserve the right to let clients sign a waiver.</li></ul><ul><li>Any travel itinerary is generally dependent on <strong>weather conditions</strong>, and its feasibility may be constrained due to exceptional environmental or social events or circumstances</li></ul><ul><li>Among others, the following <strong>Indonesian airlines</strong> are currently banned by the European Commission from operating in European airspace for safety reasons: Citilink Indonesia, Lion (Mentari) Air, Transnusa Aviation Mandiri, Trigana Air Service, Air Asia Indonesia.
